# Altimus

Altimus is a database of numbers.

These numbers can range anywhere from the total word length of the official Python programming language Tutorial doc to the amount of security cameras in the Empire State Building reception lobby. There are no restrictions on what numbers can be added or changed.

It's goal and purpose is to provide a universal library of numbers.
